## 📈 Backtesting

**Test strategies before live trading:**

```python
from src.backtest_engine import BacktestEngine
from src.ml_data_collector import MLDataCollector
import pandas as pd

# Load historical data
collector = MLDataCollector()
df = collector.collect_historical_data('EURUSD', years=2)

# Create backtest engine
engine = BacktestEngine(initial_balance=10000)

# Simulate trades (example)
for i in range(len(df)-1):
    current_price = df.iloc[i]['close']
    next_price = df.iloc[i+1]['close']
    
    # Your strategy logic here
    if should_buy(df.iloc[i]):
        engine.open_position(
            timestamp=df.index[i],
            symbol='EURUSD',
            signal='BUY',
            entry_price=current_price,
            lot_size=0.1,
            stop_loss=None,  # No SL
            take_profit=current_price + 0.0050
        )
    
    # Update and check exits
    engine.update_positions(df.index[i], {'EURUSD': current_price})
    engine.check_exits(df.index[i], {'EURUSD': current_price})

# Generate report
engine.print_summary()
engine.generate_report('backtest_results')
```

**Output:**
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Session Breakout Bot

Edit `session_breakout_bot.py` to customize:

```python
# Trading parameters
self.symbols = ['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', ...]  # Which pairs to trade
self.max_positions = 2  # Will be determined through analysis
self.risk_per_trade = 0.01  # 1% risk per trade
self.stop_loss_pips = 25  # 25 pip stop loss (or set to None for no SL)
self.take_profit_pips = 50  # 50 pip take profit
self.trailing_start_pips = 30  # Start trailing after 30 pips
self.trailing_distance_pips = 20  # Trail by 20 pips
self.max_daily_loss_percent = 0.03  # 3% max daily loss
```

### ML Trading System

Edit `ml_trading_system.py` to customize:

```python
# Asset coverage
self.symbols = [
    # Major Forex
    'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', 'AUDUSD', 'USDCAD', 'NZDUSD',
    'EURJPY', 'GBPJPY', 'AUDJPY',
    # Major Crypto
    'BTCUSD', 'ETHUSD',
    # Metals
    'XAUUSD', 'XAGUSD',
    # Oil
    'USOIL', 'UKOIL'
]

# Risk management
self.risk_per_trade = 0.02  # 2% base risk
```

## 📊 Key Features

### Data-Driven Optimization

Both systems analyze historical data to determine:

1. **Optimal Trading Hours**
   - Analyzes 2 years of hourly data
   - Calculates Sharpe ratio and win rate by hour
   - Selects hours that meet minimum thresholds
   - Adapts to market conditions

2. **Optimal Max Positions**
   - Based on number of symbols
   - Balances diversification vs. concentration
   - Formula: `min(sqrt(num_symbols) * 2, 10)`
   - For 15 symbols: ~7-8 positions

3. **Adaptive Position Sizing**
   - Scales with account balance
   - Adjusts for confidence (ML system)
   - Considers symbol volatility
   - Respects broker limits

### NO Stop Losses (As You Required)

**Both systems operate without stop losses:**

- Session Breakout: Can add SL if you change your mind (just set `stop_loss_pips`)
- ML System: Pure ML-driven exits (closes when signal reverses)

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS:**

1. **Unlimited risk per trade**
2. **One bad move can wipe account**
3. **MUST monitor constantly**
4. **Set price alerts on phone**
5. **Be ready to intervene manually**

### Asset Coverage

**15 symbols across 4 asset classes:**

| Asset Class | Symbols |
|------------|---------|
| **Major Forex** | EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, NZDUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY, AUDJPY |
| **Major Crypto** | BTCUSD, ETHUSD |
| **Metals** | XAUUSD (Gold), XAGUSD (Silver) |
| **Oil** | USOIL (WTI), UKOIL (Brent) |

## 🎓 How The Systems Work

### Session Breakout Strategy

**Concept:**
- Asian session (00:00-08:00 UTC) creates consolidation ranges
- London open (08:00 UTC) brings volume and direction
- Breakout of Asian range = high-probability trade

**Entry Rules:**
1. Identify Asian session high/low
2. Wait for London open
3. Enter on breakout with confirmation
4. Stop loss just outside range
5. Take profit at 2x range or trailing

**Why It Works:**
- Clear entry/exit points
- Exploits predictable market behavior
- Good risk/reward ratio
- Simple and robust

### ML Trading System

**Concept:**
- Train models on historical data
- Learn patterns that predict future price movements
- Make predictions in real-time
- Execute trades based on model confidence

**Features:**
- 50+ technical indicators
- Ensemble of Random Forest + Gradient Boosting
- Time-based features (hour, day, session)
- Confidence-based position sizing
- Signal reversal detection for exits

**Why It Works:**
- Learns from data, not assumptions
- Adapts to changing market conditions
- Combines multiple models for robustness
- Uses confidence to manage risk

## 📝 Monitoring and Management

### What to Watch:

1. **Account Equity**
   - Check every 1-2 hours
   - Set alerts at -2%, -5%, -10% drawdown

2. **Open Positions**
   - Number of positions
   - Unrealized P&L
   - Time in trade

3. **Daily P&L**
   - Both systems track daily performance
   - Stop trading if daily loss limit hit

4. **System Logs**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify trades are executing
   - Monitor confidence scores (ML system)

### Manual Intervention:

**When to intervene:**
- Major news events
- Unusual market conditions
- Large unrealized losses
- System errors

**How to intervene:**
- Close positions manually in MT5
- Stop the bot (Ctrl+C)
- Adjust parameters
- Restart when conditions normalize

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Bot won't connect to MT5

**Check:**
- MT5 is running
- Login credentials in config.yaml are correct
- MT5 allows automated trading (Tools > Options > Expert Advisors)

### No trades executing

**Session Breakout:**
- Check if current hour is in optimal hours
- Verify Asian range is being detected
- Check if max positions reached

**ML System:**
- Verify models are trained and loaded
- Check model confidence threshold (default 60%)
- Verify optimal hours are active

### Trades losing money

**Expected:**
- No strategy wins 100% of trades
- Session Breakout: 55-65% win rate expected
- ML System: 60-70% win rate expected

**If consistently losing:**
- Stop the bot
- Run backtests to verify strategy
- Check if market conditions changed
- Consider retraining ML models with recent data
