# Crypto Strategies - FIXED! 🚀

## What Was Broken

The crypto strategies had **fundamental errors** that prevented them from working at all:

### 1. Wrong Indicator Method Names ❌
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
df_m15 = self.ti.calculate_ema(df_m15, 20)  # Method doesn't exist!
df_m15 = self.ti.calculate_rsi(df_m15, 14)  # Method doesn't exist!
df_m15 = self.ti.calculate_atr(df_m15, 14)  # Method doesn't exist!
```

### 2. Wrong Indicator Usage ❌
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
df_m15 = self.ti.ema(df_m15, 20)  # Trying to assign Series to DataFrame!
```

### 3. Missing Columns ❌
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
df_h1 = self.ti.ema(df_h1, 50)
h1_trend = df_h1['ema_50'].iloc[-1]  # Column 'ema_50' never created!
```

**Result:** All 4 crypto strategies threw errors and couldn't execute!

---

## What's Fixed ✅

### 1. Correct Indicator Usage
```python
# NEW (CORRECT):
ema20_m15 = self.ti.ema(df_m15['close'], 20)  # Returns Series
rsi_m15 = self.ti.rsi(df_m15['close'], 14)    # Returns Series
atr_m15 = self.ti.atr(df_m15, 14)              # Returns Series

# Use the Series directly:
curr_ema = ema20_m15.iloc[-1]
curr_rsi = rsi_m15.iloc[-1]
```

### 2. Proper Logic Flow
```python
# NEW (CORRECT):
ema50_h1 = self.ti.ema(df_h1['close'], 50)
h1_bullish = df_h1['close'].iloc[-1] > ema50_h1.iloc[-1]  # Compare values directly
```

### 3. Crypto-Specific Optimizations
- **3-4x wider SL/TP** - Crypto volatility requires wider stops
- **Trailing stops enabled** - Cryptos can run far, let winners run
- **Volume confirmation** - 2-3x volume spikes required
- **Round number psychology** - BTC: 40k, 45k, 50k levels
- **24/7 trading** - No session restrictions

## Risk Management for Crypto

### Important Adjustments

1. **Lower Risk Per Trade**
   - Forex: 0.5% per trade ✅
   - Crypto: 0.3% per trade ✅ (higher volatility)

2. **Max Positions**
   - Total: 5 positions max
   - Crypto: 2 positions max (don't over-expose)
   - Forex: 3 positions max

3. **Correlation Awareness**
   - BTC/ETH/LTC are highly correlated
   - Don't open BUY on all 3 at once
   - Bot has correlation detection built-in

### Recommended Settings

```yaml
risk_management:
  risk_per_trade: 0.003  # 0.3% for crypto
  max_positions: 5
  max_crypto_positions: 2  # Limit crypto exposure
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No crypto signals"**  
→ Normal during low volatility. Crypto strategies are selective.

**"SL too wide"**  
→ Normal for crypto. 90-150 pips is correct for BTC/ETH volatility.

**"Trailing stop not updating"**  
→ Check logs. Should update every scan when in profit.

**"Too many crypto positions"**  
→ Reduce `max_crypto_positions` in config.

---

## Summary

**Crypto strategies are now FIXED and READY!** 🚀

✅ Correct indicator usage  
✅ Proper logic flow  
✅ Crypto-specific optimizations  
✅ 3-4x wider SL/TP  
✅ Trailing stops enabled  
✅ 24/7 trading support
