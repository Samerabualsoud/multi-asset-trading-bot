# Strategy V3 - Major Enhancements

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Version:** 3.0 (Enhanced Strict Strategy)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for deployment

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Lot Size Calculation Fixed** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Inconsistent lot sizes (0.01 to 5.20 lots)

**Solution:**
- Risk reduced back to 2% of balance
- Removed fixed minimum lots that caused issues
- Proportional scaling based on account size
- Consistent calculation across all pairs

**Result:** Predictable, proportional lot sizes

### 2. **Maximum Position Limit Added** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Bot opened 16 positions simultaneously

**Solution:**
- Maximum 5 concurrent positions enforced
- Bot stops opening new trades when limit reached
- Prevents overexposure

**Result:** Better risk management and focus

### 3. **Minimum Confidence Increased to 85%** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Too many low-quality trades

**Solution:**
- All sessions now require 85% minimum confidence
- Much stricter filtering
- Only highest quality setups pass

**Result:** Fewer but much better trades

### 4. **ADX Filter Made Mandatory** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Trading in weak, choppy markets

**Solution:**
- ADX must be > 25 (previously optional)
- Trades rejected if ADX < 25
- Only trades strong trends

**Result:** No more choppy market losses

## Strategy Enhancements

**After:**
- **Precise distance calculations**

  - Acceptable zone: +8 points
  - Wrong zone: -5 points (penalty)

**Impact:** Better momentum confirmation

### F. ADX Now Mandatory

**Before:**
- ADX optional, gave bonus points

**After:**
- **ADX > 25 REQUIRED** (rejects if lower)
- ADX > 30: +20 points (very strong trend)
- ADX 25-30: +10 points (strong trend)
- ADX < 25: REJECTED

**Impact:** No more weak trend trades

### G. Price Action Confirmation Added

**New Features:**

- Penalizes weak price structure

**Impact:** Additional layer of confirmation

```yaml
symbols:
  # Remove exotic pairs, keep only majors
  - EURUSD
  - GBPUSD
  - USDJPY
  - AUDUSD
  - USDCAD
  - NZDUSD

```

### 3. Pull and Restart

```bash
cd /path/to/multi-asset-trading-bot
git pull
python src/main_bot.py
```

### 4. Monitor First Day

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No trades executing

**Expected:** This is normal! V3 is very strict.

**Check:**
- Are most signals showing "REJECTED"? (Good!)
- What are rejection reasons? (Should be valid)
- Is ADX < 25 on most pairs? (Wait for stronger trends)
- Is confidence < 85%? (Wait for better setups)

**Action:** Be patient. Quality > quantity.

### Issue: Still opening too many positions

**Check:**
- Is max position limit working? (Should see "Maximum positions reached")
- Are you trading too many symbols? (Reduce to 8-10 major pairs)

**Action:** Verify code update, reduce symbol list.

### Issue: Lot sizes still inconsistent

**Check:**
- What's your account balance?
- Are you trading crypto vs forex? (Different pip sizes)

**Action:** Check logs for lot calculation details.
