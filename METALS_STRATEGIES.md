## üöÄ Strategy 1: Safe-Haven Flow Trading

### Concept
Gold and silver rise during market uncertainty and USD weakness. This strategy trades the risk-on/risk-off sentiment.

### Entry Conditions
1. **H4 trend established** (EMA 20 > EMA 50 for bullish)
2. **USD index moving opposite** direction
3. **H1 confirmation** (price above/below EMA 20)
4. **RSI not extreme** (40-70 range)

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 1.5x ATR
- **TP:** 3x ATR
- **Trailing stop:** Activated at 50% of TP

### Best For
- Risk-off events (market crashes, geopolitical tensions)
- USD weakness periods
- Inflation concerns

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 70-75%
Risk:Reward: 1:2
Best Timeframes: H1, H4
```

### Example
```
Market crash ‚Üí Risk-off sentiment
USD index falling from 105 to 104
Gold H4 uptrend: EMA 20 > EMA 50
H1 pullback to EMA 20 at $1,950

Entry: BUY at $1,952
SL: $1,935 (17 pips)
TP: $1,985 (33 pips)

Result: Gold rallies to $1,990
Profit: +33 pips
```

## üìä Strategy 2: USD Inverse Correlation

### Concept
Gold typically moves inverse to the USD. When USD makes a strong move but gold hasn't reacted yet, there's a lag opportunity.

### Entry Conditions
1. **USD strong move** (>0.5% in 5 candles)
2. **Gold hasn't moved** yet (<0.3% change)
3. **USD RSI extreme** (>60 or <40)
4. **USD above/below EMA 20**

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 1.2x ATR (tight)
- **TP:** 2.5x ATR
- **No trailing** (quick scalp)

### Best For
- USD-driven moves
- Quick scalps (2-6 hours)
- High-probability setups

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 75-80%
Risk:Reward: 1:2
Best Timeframes: H1
```

### Example
```
USD index surges +0.8% in 2 hours
Gold flat: only -0.2% change
USD RSI: 72 (overbought)

Entry: SELL Gold at $1,960
SL: $1,972 (12 pips)
TP: $1,930 (30 pips)

Result: Gold drops to catch up with USD
Profit: +30 pips
```

## üí• Strategy 3: Technical Breakout

### Concept
Classic technical analysis - trade breakouts of key support/resistance levels with volume confirmation.

### Entry Conditions
1. **Price breaks key level** (support or resistance)
2. **Volume confirms** (>1.5x average)
3. **RSI momentum** supports direction
4. **Clean breakout** (not false break)

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 1.3x distance to level
- **TP:** Next major level
- **Trailing stop:** Activated at 50% of TP

### Best For
- Range-bound markets breaking out
- Clear support/resistance levels
- Patient traders

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 70-75%
Risk:Reward: 1:2 to 1:3
Best Timeframes: H1, H4
```

### Example
```
Gold consolidating $1,940-$1,960 for 3 days
Resistance at $1,960 tested 3 times
Price breaks above $1,962 with 2.1x volume
RSI: 58 (momentum)

Entry: BUY at $1,963
SL: $1,950 (13 pips)
TP: $1,995 (next resistance, 32 pips)

Result: Breakout continues to $2,000
Profit: +32 pips
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. News Events
Gold is **highly sensitive** to:
- Fed announcements (interest rates)
- CPI/inflation data
- Geopolitical events
- USD data (NFP, GDP, etc.)

**Avoid trading 30 min before/after major news**

### 2. Spread Widening
Spreads can **widen dramatically** during:
- Low liquidity periods
- Major news events
- Market opens/closes

Always check spread before entering.

### 3. Correlation Breaks
USD-Gold correlation can **temporarily break**:
- During extreme events
- When both are safe havens
- Technical factors override fundamentals

Don't force trades when correlation breaks.

### 4. Silver Volatility
Silver is **1.5-2x more volatile** than gold:
- Wider stops needed
- Larger swings
- Lower position size recommended

### 5. Position Sizing
Recommended sizing for metals:
```
Gold: 0.3-0.5% risk per trade
Silver: 0.2-0.4% risk per trade (more volatile)
Maximum 2-3 metals positions total
```
