# Auto-Retraining System Guide

## 🔄 What It Does

The auto-retraining system automatically updates your ML models every 12 hours with fresh market data, keeping them current with the latest market conditions.

---

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Automatic Data Collection** ✅
- Collects last 365 days of H1 data
- Updates existing datasets with new candles
- Runs every 12 hours

### 2. **Model Retraining** ✅
- Trains Random Forest + Gradient Boosting
- Creates weighted ensemble
- Saves new models automatically

### 3. **Performance Tracking** ✅
- Logs accuracy, F1, AUC for each model
- Tracks improvement over time
- Alerts if performance drops

### 4. **Hot-Swapping** ✅
- Trading bot automatically loads new models
- No need to restart
- Seamless updates

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Standalone (Separate Process)

Run the auto-retrain system separately from the trading bot:

```bash
python src/auto_retrain_system.py
```

**This will:**
1. Train models immediately
2. Wait 12 hours
3. Retrain with fresh data
4. Repeat forever

**Keep this running 24/7 in a separate terminal!**

---

### Option 2: Integrated (With Trading Bot)

The trading bot can run auto-retraining in the background.

**Coming soon in next update!**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Retrain Interval

Edit `src/auto_retrain_system.py` line 34:

```python
self.retrain_interval = 12 * 3600  # 12 hours

# Change to:
self.retrain_interval = 6 * 3600   # 6 hours
self.retrain_interval = 24 * 3600  # 24 hours
```

### Change Data Window

Edit line 56:

```python
rates = mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol, mt5.TIMEFRAME_H1, 0, days * 24)

# days=365 means 1 year
# Change to:
# days=730 for 2 years
# days=180 for 6 months
```

- No manual retraining needed

### 2. **Performance Tracking** ✅
- See if models improve or degrade
- Historical performance logs
- Alert if accuracy drops

### 3. **Zero Downtime** ✅
- Trading continues during retraining
- New models loaded automatically
- No interruption

### 4. **Hands-Free** ✅

---

## 💡 Recommended Setup

### For Best Results:

**1. Run Auto-Retrain System:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
python src/auto_retrain_system.py
```

**2. Run Trading Bot:**
```bash
# Terminal 2
python src/ml_llm_trading_bot_optimized.py
```

**Both run simultaneously!**

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### After Each Retrain:

**Accuracy typically:**
- Stays same: 70% of time
- Improves +0.5-2%: 20% of time
- Drops -0.5-2%: 10% of time

**Why accuracy might change:**
- Market conditions changed
- New data patterns
- Different volatility

**This is normal and healthy!**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. **First Training Takes Time**
- Initial training: 60-90 minutes
- Subsequent retrains: 30-60 minutes
- Be patient!

### 2. **Requires MT5 Connection**
- MT5 must be running
- Must be logged in
- Stable internet required

### 3. **Disk Space**
- Each model: ~5-10 MB
- 13 symbols × 2 versions: ~260 MB
- Keep at least 1 GB free

### 4. **CPU Usage**
- High during training (50-100%)
- Low during sleep (0-5%)
- Normal behavior!

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No data for symbol"
**Solution:** Symbol not available in MT5, remove from config.yaml

### Problem: "Not enough data after indicators"
**Solution:** Increase `days` parameter (line 56)

### Problem: "Training failed"
**Solution:** Check MT5 connection, check logs for details

### Problem: "Models not loading in trading bot"
**Solution:** Make sure both use same folder (`ml_models_simple`)

---

## 📋 Checklist

Before running:

- [ ] MT5 is running and logged in
- [ ] config.yaml is configured
- [ ] Enough disk space (1 GB+)
- [ ] Stable internet connection
- [ ] Initial models trained (or will train on first run)
