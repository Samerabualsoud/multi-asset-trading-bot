---

## üöÄ Strategy 1: Momentum Breakout

### Concept
Cryptocurrencies have explosive momentum - when they break out, they RUN. This strategy catches these moves early.

### Entry Conditions
1. **Price breaks 20-period high/low** on M15
2. **Volume confirms** (2x average volume)
3. **RSI shows momentum** (>60 for buy, <40 for sell)
4. **H1 trend confirms** direction

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 2x ATR below/above entry
- **TP:** 4-6x ATR (cryptos can run far)
- **Trailing stop:** Activated at 40% of TP

### Best For
- BTC, ETH during high volatility
- News-driven breakouts
- Market open moves

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 65-75%
Risk:Reward: 1:2 to 1:3
Best Timeframes: M15, H1
```

### Example
```
BTC breaks above $45,000 (20-period high)
Volume: 3.2x average
RSI: 68
H1 trend: Bullish

Entry: BUY at $45,050
SL: $44,200 (850 pips)
TP: $46,700 (1650 pips)

Result: Price runs to $47,200, trailing stop exits at $46,500
Profit: +1450 pips
```

## üìä Strategy 2: Support/Resistance Bounce

### Concept
Cryptos respect key levels and round numbers. BTC at $40k, $45k, $50k acts like a magnet.

### Entry Conditions
1. **Price bounces off major S/R level**
2. **Confluence with round numbers** (within 1%)
3. **Volume spike** on bounce
4. **RSI confirms** (oversold at support, overbought at resistance)

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 1.5x distance to level
- **TP:** Next major level
- **No trailing** (fixed target at level)

### Best For
- Range-bound markets
- Round number levels
- High-confidence setups

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 70-80%
Risk:Reward: 1:1.5 to 1:2
Best Timeframes: H1, H4
```

### Example
```
ETH drops to $2,000 support (round number)
Previous bounces at $2,010, $1,995, $2,005
RSI: 35 (oversold)
Volume: 2.5x on bounce candle

Entry: BUY at $2,015
SL: $1,985 (30 pips)
TP: $2,150 (next resistance, 135 pips)

Result: Price bounces to $2,165
Profit: +135 pips (TP hit)
```

## üìà Strategy 3: Multi-Timeframe Trend Following

### Concept
Crypto trends are STRONG and last for weeks/months. Catch pullbacks in established trends.

### Entry Conditions
1. **H4 trend established** (EMA 20 > EMA 50)
2. **H1 pullback** to EMA 20
3. **M15 reversal signal** (price crosses EMA 10)

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 2.5x ATR
- **TP:** 6x ATR (let it run!)
- **Trailing stop:** Activated at 30% of TP

### Best For
- Strong trending markets
- BTC/ETH bull/bear runs
- Patient traders

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 60-70%
Risk:Reward: 1:2.5 to 1:4
Best Timeframes: M15, H1, H4
```

### Example
```
BTC H4 uptrend: EMA 20 ($44,500) > EMA 50 ($42,000)
H1 pullback to $44,300 (near EMA 20)
M15 reversal: Price crosses above EMA 10

Entry: BUY at $44,400
SL: $43,600 (800 pips)
TP: $47,200 (2800 pips)
Trailing: Activate at $45,240

Result: Trend continues to $48,500
Trailing stop exits at $47,800
Profit: +3400 pips
```

### Entry Conditions
1. **Bollinger Band squeeze** (width < 70% of average)
2. **Price breaks out** of bands
3. **Volume confirms** (>1.5x average)

### Exit Strategy
- **SL:** 2.5x ATR
- **TP:** 6x ATR (breakouts are big)
- **Trailing stop:** Activated at 40% of TP

### Best For
- After consolidation periods
- Low volatility environments
- Explosive moves

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 60-70%
Risk:Reward: 1:2 to 1:3
Best Timeframes: H1, H4
```

### Example

BTC consolidating in $43,000-$44,000 range for 3 days
BB width: 0.015 (70% below average of 0.022)
Price breaks above upper band at $44,200

## üí° Crypto-Specific Adjustments

### 1. Wider Stops
Cryptos need **2-4x wider stops** than forex:
- Forex: 20-40 pips typical
- Crypto: 50-150 pips typical

### 2. Trailing Stops Essential
Crypto moves can be **explosive**:
- Always use trailing stops
- Activate early (30-40% of TP)
- Trail at 40-50% of original SL

### 3. Round Number Psychology
Key levels for BTC:
- $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $55,000, $60,000

Key levels for ETH:
- $2,000, $2,500, $3,000, $3,500, $4,000

### 4. Volume Matters More
Crypto volume is **critical**:
- 2x volume = strong signal
- 3x volume = very strong signal
- Low volume = skip the trade

### 5. News/Sentiment Impact
Crypto is **highly news-driven**:
- Check crypto news before trading
- Avoid trading during major announcements
- Use sentiment analysis (GPT-4)
